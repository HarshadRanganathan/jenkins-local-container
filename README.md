```

`Note: Only superuser has access to view/edit Manage Jenkins page. Check authorizationStrategy matrix in jenkins.yaml file`

### Plugins

List of plugins to be installed is defined in `plugins.txt` file.

`Note: If you are running in windows, make sure that the plugins.txt file line ending is LF instead of CRLF. Otherwise, the plugin installation will fail with Illegal characters found in URL error`

### System Configuration

System configuration is defined in the file `jenkins.yaml`.

### LDAP

We run `SLDAP` service which is a stand-alone LDAP daemon. 

To administer the LDAP service, we make use of `phpLDAPadmin` which is a web-based LDAP client providing multi-language administration for your LDAP server.

`phpLDAPadmin` is available at http://localhost:8090/.
